Surprisingly Great!,"Reviewed in the United States on November 3, 2022","I’m writing this review because I am actually
Overly satisfied with this product. There are many high quality brands that have similar “water flossers” with high price tags. The price on this was relatively inexpensive so I decided to try it knowing Amazon’s great return policy.

I’ve had it for just over a week and I’m borderline addicted to how good my teeth feel after using this along with normal brushing and mouthwash. It’s a legit “just left the dentist feeling” I can say for the price it is a good value and works great.

This comes with a few extra standard heads, a specialized head with small brush for braces and a tongue scraper. I primarily use the standard head which is just a small jet that allows you to shoot the water stream between your teeth. I also have used the tongue scraper just to try it and it’s not bad. Allows you to scrape your tongue while a stream of water cleans and rinses.

Anyone who flosses regularly knows it sucks and can be gross. Let’s face it, you are ripping old food out of your teeth. It’s a necessary evil for a healthy mouth. I used the small plastic floss picks for a while and they do a decent job. Dental hygienists usually argue it’s not the same but I think it’s better than not flossing at all. Now my routine is a quick floss with the floss picks followed by this water flosser - and it’s fantastic.

The unit is well made and has a few different modes. I stick to the standard mode which is a constant jet of water. It’s aggressive and can be intimidating at first so here are some tips I think will help:

1. I use slightly warm water. Cold water blasted at your teeth is not fun. Warm water is a way better experience. The reservoir is easy to fill right from the sink.
2. It will take a couple tries to figure exactly how to use it. If you just hit the power button it will jet water everywhere before you get it in your mouth. My suggestion is put it in your mouth, aim the head between your teeth, close your mouth and then hit the power button. Once it starts you just move it from tooth to tooth between your teeth. Once you get the hang of it it’s great. I do my top teeth, spit out, then do the bottom row and spit out. I follow it up with brushing and mouthwash. Literally the fresh from the dentist feeling.
3. The reservoir is small so it runs out quickly but it’s so easy to refill I wouldn’t call it an issue. If it were larger it would be bulky and the other brands that have a big tank and hose are just too much to deal with. After a week of using I can quickly do all my teeth with one fill. I usually do a second round as well because im addicted.
4. Be careful of turning it on when it’s not in your mouth. The jet is strong and could shoot you in the eye. Not joking.
5. It may be awkward at first but once you get used to doing it you get better at it and it’s much easier. The power button is your friend. I turn it on and off to control the jetting to get more time out of the reservoir and to prevent spraying everywhere.
6. It has a USB charger and it works well. It seems to go almost a week without charging and I use twice a day sometimes - because I’m addicted.
Overall it’s great value for the low price. I’m Not sure how long it will last but I would definitely get another one if this one failed."
Replaced after emailing Nicwell customer service….Thank you Nicwell,"Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2024","For the first month, the water flosser was everything I had hoped for. It transformed my nightly routine into a refreshing experience, and I felt a sense of accomplishment knowing I was taking great care of my teeth. Friends and family noticed my radiant smile, and I couldn’t help but brag about her new gadget.
However, just as I was settling into my routine, disaster struck. One evening, as I prepared to floss, the water flosser sputtered and then went silent. Confused, I checked the power source and the water reservoir, but nothing seemed to work. Panic set in as I realized that my beloved device had only lasted four months.
Determined to resolve the issue, I dug out the warranty card and dialed the customer service number. After navigating through a series of automated prompts, she finally reached a representative.
“Thank you for calling. How can I assist you today?” the representative asked cheerfully.
“I’m having trouble with my water flosser. It stopped working after just four months,” I explained, his voice tinged with frustration.
“I’m sorry to hear that,” the representative replied. “Can I have your order number, please?”
After a few moments of searching, the representative returned with a frown in their voice. “I see that your purchase was made four months ago. Unfortunately, our return policy only covers the first 30 days. I’m afraid we can’t offer a replacement.”
I felt my heart sink. “But it’s a defective product! I thought warranties covered issues like this.”
“I understand your frustration, but the policy is quite strict,” the representative said, their tone now more formal. “You might consider contacting the manufacturer directly, but I can’t guarantee they’ll be able to help.”
Feeling defeated, I thanked the representative and hung up the phone. I couldn’t believe that a product I had trusted and loved had failed me so quickly, and the customer service I had hoped would assist me had only added to my disappointment.
In the days that followed, I found myself reflecting on her experience. I realized that while the water flosser had been a great tool, the lack of support when it mattered most had left me feeling disheartened. I returned to traditional flossing, albeit with a newfound appreciation for the simplicity of it.
Though the water flosser was gone, I learned a valuable lesson about the importance of understanding return policies and the risks of relying too heavily on technology. And while I might eventually try another model, I would always remember to read the fine print and keep my expectations in check.

However, after reflecting on my situation, I decided to reach out via email to the company. To my surprise, they responded promptly and offered to replace the flosser at no cost. This gesture restored my faith in the brand and showed me that they genuinely care about their customers.

I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude for replacing my water flosser after just a few short email exchanges. Your prompt and helpful response made a significant difference in my experience, and I truly appreciate your commitment to customer satisfaction.
The water flosser has been a fantastic addition to my dental care routine, and I’m thrilled to have a replacement that I can rely on. Thank you once again for your excellent service and support!"
Great while it lasts,"Reviewed in the United States on June 6, 2025","I bought this and enjoyed it for about a year and 9 months. Then one day, it just stopped working. I tried charging thinking it was dead, but that wasn't the problem. Apparently the battery in these things just dies after so long. I'm giving it 4 stars since mine lasted longer than some peoples, and because I really liked it while it worked."
Buy this instead of the fancy expensive ones,"Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2025","We bought this water flosser in late 2022 and use it regularly. This product is a beast. I've had a Water Pik in the past but don't have space now, and this product is just as good, cheaper and much more compact. This version keeps a charge forever - we've charged it twice in over 2 years! It comes with multiple heads, the pressure levels are significantly different for different needs or tolerances, and it's easy to use. Save your money and just get this flosser. My son made it through 2-1/2 years of braces with no cavities in between his teeth, and I am a compulsive flosser who uses this 2-3 times per-week for things like pineapple strings and popcorn hulls that get stuck. It's a rare product that is both affordable and durable."
"A bit awkward at first, but totally worth it","Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2025","My dentist told me to get a water flosser and I’m so glad I listened. It definitely takes a little getting used to — you will accidentally spray your mirror the first few times, but once you get the hang of it, it makes your mouth feel insanely clean.

You’ll want to charge it regularly, clean it out every so often, and fill it before each use. But overall, it’s easy to use and makes me feel like I’ve leveled up my dental hygiene game."
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Amazing Water Flosser – A Game Changer for My Oral Hygiene!,"Reviewed in the United States on June 1, 2025","I can’t believe I waited so long to get this water flosser! It’s been a total game changer for my dental routine. From the very first use, I noticed how fresh and clean my mouth felt—way better than traditional flossing. It’s super easy to use, and the different pressure settings make it perfect for both my sensitive gums and deeper cleaning when needed.

The water tank holds enough for a full cleaning, and the cordless design makes it super convenient. My dentist even noticed a difference at my last checkup! I highly recommend this to anyone looking to level up their oral care. You won’t regret it!"
DOES NOT COME WITH CHARGING CORD,"Reviewed in the United States on June 21, 2025","I honestly JUST opened the package, so I can't tell you if this product is good or not, but I'm gonna give it three stars BECAUSE IT DOESN'T COME WITH A CHARGING CORD INCLUDED! I have never purchased a rechargeable device before that was unusable until you go back and order the $8 cord. Why do they not tell you this when you are ordering it? Now I understand why it was only $28.99, but it still annoys me that I had no idea they sold the cord separately. So absurd."
Updated review. Disappointed but seller stood behind product.,"Reviewed in the United States on April 3, 2025","I have had this water dental flosser for less than a year. I was very happy with how it worked at first. It did a great job getting in between my teeth and around my gums clean especially around my crowns. As of December I was very upset when I found that it would no longer take a charge. When I plug it in to charge it the blue light blinks but the unit never charges. I even tried to use it while it was plugged in and that is not an option.
After submitting this review but not wanting to give up I plugged the unit in and unplugged it a few times and it started to charge for the first time in months. It was completely dead. Not sure what the issue is but will try using it again. The seller reached out and issued a refund for the item. I give them a lot of credit for doing that. Don't see that very often these days. I commend this seller for their integrity which is why I changed the rating."
"8 months, no longer works. Seller refunded.","Reviewed in the United States on June 12, 2025","Lasted 8 months, now dead. I expected a few years at least. The seller saw this feedback and refunded me. That is fair."
Charging your Nickwell Oral Irrigator,"Reviewed in the United States on May 13, 2025","I wrote a review previously and having issues around the charging light. Information on the product stated about 4 hrs to charge however after 30 minutes light stopped blinking and shut off completely. Is this normal or is the unit still charging. Must the unit be completely unplugged after each use and be reconnected while coordinating with the charging light.
Thanks. Dennis"
Good buy,"Reviewed in the United States on June 20, 2025","This has changed my flossing life! Its durable, fits in the medicine cabinet, and so easy to use! I love that I can pack it anywhere too."
"Mixed experiences, but good customer service.","Reviewed in the United States on May 28, 2025","I have purchased two of these. One has been working great, and the other broke after 6 months, but the seller offered a full refund."
Very Good Water Pik,"Reviewed in the United States on May 18, 2025","Works well, cleans exceptionally good, functions to great capacity, the water pressure is sufficient to do what it's supposed to do and it's comfortable to use, not too aggressive. I would recommend."
Absolutely incredible for the price wish there was a little lower setting on the pressure,"Reviewed in the United States on May 2, 2025","That actually works a heck of a lot better than I thought it was going to, even on the lowest setting though the pressure is a little high you have to put it on custom if you're going to do the back of your throat or tonsils because it hurts mine and I got it for teeth and tonsils."
Easy to use!,"Reviewed in the United States on June 11, 2025",So easy to use that my kids love it! The water pressure and cleaning ability is great. Very light weight and keeps a charge for weeks.
Good water pick,"Reviewed in the United States on June 1, 2025",I love using this water flosser in the shower. It adds an extra layer to my dental care and I feel it is worth the price. The battery has held up well and it seems solid
Its Good. it will do the job.,"Reviewed in the United States on May 27, 2025",its good. it will do
Love it,"Reviewed in the United States on May 27, 2025","You won't believe what's been hiding in that dirty mouth of yours!

New user tip, turn it off before you take it out of your mouth or it will look like a sprinkler went off in your bathroom!

Honestly, I can't live without it!"
This thing is mighty!!,"Reviewed in the United States on May 16, 2025",Wow!! Just wow. This definitely has a lot of power i had purchased a water flosser from the tiktok shop that was great but the tank wasn't so big I love that this one has the option to take the tank off and it's really big. The attachments it comes with as well are very helpful in maintaining a clean mouth!! This was an awesome purchase
Easy to use product.,"Reviewed in the United States on May 27, 2025",I like it.
Amazing,"Reviewed in the United States on June 5, 2025",I love it. I have had it for a while now and didn’t need to charge it yet although I use it on daily basis
Great for Dental Hygiene,"Reviewed in the United States on June 3, 2025","Love the Attachments pieces options !
Has been a great addition to my Dental Hygiene Routine !
Gums feel great !
very Easy to use."
Water flosser works great and the seller’s customer service is amazing!,"Reviewed in the United States on March 11, 2025","This is a great water flosser and the customer service of this seller is stellar!

First of all, this is my third water flosser (all different brands). I use this on the highest custom setting because my teeth and gums are very accustomed to water flossing. The unit is easy to use and the water pressure is great. If setting the custom mode, it only changes the setting while the unit is running, so it’s easiest to turn the unit on when empty, choose your setting.

The tank is really large and gives plenty of water flossing time. I add hydrogen peroxide to the water in the tank to help whiten my teeth. The tank is also easy to empty as the hole has nothing sticking up inside the tank to stop the water from flowing out of the hole. Other brands I’ve had make it impossible to completely empty the tank as the water will never flow out of the hole.

My unit had a problem with the battery not holding a charge when I tried charging it for the first time. I contacted the seller directly to tell them about the issue. They sent me a new unit immediately! Such good customer service shouldn’t be ignored, so buy with confidence. They stand behind their products. Highly recommend!"
Great Flosser!,"Reviewed in the United States on March 18, 2025","I resisted using a water flossed for years because I thought the idea of drooling out water was pretty gross. I have a history of perio issues so I finally gave it a try. Aside from learning not to hit the button at the wrong time not as bad as I thought. And tge results are amazing! This fits nicely in the hand. Totally ergo man! My only complaint is the black mold(?) that grows inside. I've tried washing, sanitizing and brushing but still there. Back to being grossed out!"
Great,"Reviewed in the United States on June 3, 2025",Works great. Love all of the different attachments too. Easy to clean and doesn't take up tons of space.
Surprisingly good,"Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2025",Was actually surprised when used for the first time not too mention the different modes helps out a lot of if you have sensitive teeth
Nicwell Water Dental Flosser: Power A+ Battery Charge A+ Durability B,"Reviewed in the United States on December 27, 2024","I bought one of these Nicwell Water Dental Flossers in August 2023 based on Amazon reviews. It served me well, then just stopped charging last week. I really like the unit, so I just purchased a new one. It has great power to blast out food particles from between the teeth. And, when it was working, it held a charge for several days of extended use.

The flosser comes with standard tips, including one with a tiny brush at the end. But, it appears the simple tip does the job. I would like them to include the MiracleSmile type surround head. That would be useful.

The issue is how durable are these units. I find 15 months is about par for the course, even from a WaterPik. These units are better designed than the WaterPik and don't collect black mold, like I had with the bigger name brand.

Will do a follow up review in a few months and let you know how the Nicwell Water Dental Flosser holds up this time."
STRONG!!,"Reviewed in the United States on May 21, 2025",Be careful if you don't know what you are doing. It is a bit messy and a learning curve but you instantly feel your teeth getting clean. The water pressure is very strong as well!
"Love it, highly recommend. Edited to 4 stars April 2022","Reviewed in the United States on July 2, 2021","EDIT APRIL 14, 2022: I bought this in late June 2021, loved it, and left a positive review. However, yesterday while I was using it, it just shut off and stopped working. I thought it needed charged, so I put it on the charger overnight, but it did not charge. So it's toast after about 10 months. I thought I should add this to my review. I haven't decided how I feel about it. All of the positive things I said about it remain true, and I enjoyed using it and it was easy to use. I don't remember what I paid for it, it's currently about $30. Is 10 months a reasonable working life for something in that price range? Should it have lasted much longer? I guess that's up to each person to decide for themselves. I need to replace it, and I haven't decided yet whether I will just re-order this same one, or try something different. But all of the positive things I said in my original review are still true, it just stopped working sooner than I would have expected, and I thought in the interest of full disclosure I would add this to my review.

Original Review July 2021:

My dentist suggested I get a water flosser. I researched a bunch, both in local stores and here on Amazon, and finally chose this one. I feel it was a good choice. I can't say enough good things about this water flosser. I'm going to try to mention most of the things that I had questions or concerns about while looking for one.

It's extremely easy to use. It's easy to fill with water. You can fill it straight from the tap, but I have nasty tap water, so I put spring water in a glass measuring cup, warm it slightly in the microwave, then pour it in. The water reservoir has an opening to fill it, with a nice sturdy hinged plastic cap, or the reservoir also removes entirely from the unit and you can fill it from the top. It holds about 3/4 C, and I do fill it twice to do my teeth thoroughly.

It has four modes: normal, soft, pulse, and custom. The booklet that comes with it gives instructions for setting the custom setting. I haven't tried it yet because I'm happy with the 'soft' and 'pulse' settings.

It comes with 5 tips: 2 regular ones; 1 that has a little rubber tip for getting into the pockets in your gums; one with a hard brush for braces; and a tongue cleaner (an often overlooked thing, but useful!) They are easy to swap out. I especially like the addition of the pocket cleaner. I can't vouch for how effective it is, but it's got to be better than regular floss, which can't get into pockets. I alternate between that one and the regular tips.

It comes with a USB charging cord, but not the adapter part you plug into a socket, though you can use any adapter (like for a cell phone), and also can plug it into your computer's USB port or a portable battery pack, so including one really wasn't necessary (I have enough of them floating around already!). I only had to charge it for an hour or two when it first arrived for it to be fully charged. I don't know how long the charge lasts because I've only had it for 2 days, but with the ease of charging it, I'm not concerned about that. I've used it multiple times in those 2 days, and it hasn't slowed down yet.

I have just found it very comfortable to hold and easy to use, I like having the different tips, and I think it is a great product. I'm glad I chose this one, I can't see the point in spending twice as much or more for some of the others that don't have anything that this one doesn't have."
GREAT PRODUCT,"Reviewed in the United States on May 4, 2025",This is a great hand-held battery-operated water pic. It really works great and hold a long power charge. It is a convenient size and easy to take when traveling. It cleans well and does a great job. It is exactly as described with no water leakage. It was a great value for the money. I recommend this product.
Easy and convenient to use,"Reviewed in the United States on April 28, 2025",This is easy and convenient. And it works! My dentist could tell.
Love it,"Reviewed in the United States on June 10, 2025","Great item, dentist recommended"
Satisfacción!,"Reviewed in the United States on June 8, 2025",En amazon se compra CALIDAD.
Good Product,"Reviewed in the United States on June 3, 2025",Works very well. Needs recharged (USB) about once a month.
This is a game changer!,"Reviewed in the United States on April 22, 2025","I always wondered why someone didn't invent a water pick that you could use in the shower. Well, this company did - and I have to say it's definitely a game changer. Wonderful - - no more mess at the kitchen sink. After about 2 months, it will need to be recharged - just plug it in and in an hour it's ready to go for another couple of months. This is a wonderful thing!"
100% recomendado,"Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2025","Perfecto, lo recomiendo muchísimo, le dura mucho su batería y hace muy bien su función"
feel like clean teeth?,"Reviewed in the United States on May 14, 2025","a nice gum massage, clean feeling, clean teeth.
always gets the hard to reach spots. careful with the plastic tips. I broke one, and couldn't get it out.
fortunately its easy to replace."
This is a must have for those who travel often.,"Reviewed in the United States on May 9, 2025","I love this portable and easy-to-travel-with option for gum care. While it is bothersome to keep re-filling it, overall, for the ease of use and portability, it's a winner. I often put a bit of mouthwash in with the water, and it's delightful."
👍,"Reviewed in the United States on June 8, 2025",Buen producto
Cuidado personal,"Reviewed in the United States on June 7, 2025",Muy buena calidad
Great presure,"Reviewed in the United States on May 28, 2025",Very good pressure comes with the bunch of tips and overall it's a great product
Buy,"Reviewed in the United States on June 8, 2025",Excellent
Great waterflosser,"Reviewed in the United States on December 27, 2024",I had mines for about 3 years before it died on me but I think it only died on me because I got water really into the charging part. If you take care of it better then it will most likely last longer. This was my first water flosser and it was easy to use. Keep it clean and it will serve you well. I did have to fill it up about 2-3 times to throughly get all of my teeth though. It’s easy to hold and navigate. I usually kept mine charge immediately after each use so I don’t really know how long the battery last when not plugged in. (Also side note: just because you have a water flosser doesn’t mean you still don’t need to use traditional floss once in a while. That is for any water flossing/pik brand.)
great product,"Reviewed in the United States on June 2, 2025",love this product! I use daily.
excellent product; would buy again,"Reviewed in the United States on March 19, 2025","Updated to 4 stars. After my first 3 star review, the seller reached out to me and refunded my price. I had already purchased a replacement nicwell from them.
Good product; very powerful and good sized water reservoir. Died after 1 year of use. Maybe that's typical of manufactured products these days?"
works great especially if you have implants,"Reviewed in the United States on May 12, 2025",great product works as directed. Might need to floss if you have built on plaque or tartar. but it does great if you have implants and need to get any food that might stick.
Good company,"Reviewed in the United States on February 18, 2025","Update: The company refunded my money, so I think they're worth 4 stars for standing behind their product like that.

I gave it 4 stars initially because i could not get it above the lowest pressure setting. It died after 6 months, which is half as long i expected it to last, so I give it half as many stars. I was honestly glad it died so I had to get a better one, so maybe 1 star would be more appropriate."
from order to my door in less than 4 hours,"Reviewed in the United States on May 21, 2025",its a good product...just got it yesterday and used it last night and i could a big difference
Works Pretty Good!,"Reviewed in the United States on October 20, 2024","I’ve been putting this Water Flosser to the test, & honey, let me tell you, my mouth has never felt so fresh! It’s got not one, not two, but FOUR modes—soft, normal, pulse, & strong. Now, I started on the soft setting because, you know, sensitive gums & all that, but once I got comfortable? Oh, I’m all about that pulse mode for a deeper clean. It gets into places regular flossing just can’t reach—you know the spots I’m talking about. Now let’s talk convenience. This little cordless wonder is perfect for travel, fits right in the bag, & the battery life? It’s holding up like a champ—I’m talking once a month charging, people. Plus, it’s waterproof, so you can floss in the shower. Multitasking at its finest! Now, real talk, the water tank could be a smidge bigger. You might need to refill it if you’re going all in on that deep clean. But, overall, this flosser is the real deal. My dentist should be giving this thing a round of applause! If you want something portable that actually works, the Nicwell’s got you covered. You’re welcome. Floss on!"
Never going back to floss,"Reviewed in the United States on April 11, 2025",LOVE THIS WATER FLOSSER! First one I ever bought and it does wonders. Got it to help clean my mouth/sockets after wisdom teeth removal and fell in love. My mouth has never felt so clean and I look forward to it every time I brush my teeth! I will never go back to regular floss! It is a breeze once you get the hang of it. And it’s honestly not that messy. Just keep your mouth shut and spit when you need too. Will be buying them as gifts for everyone 😆
