,The most amazing hydrating product - not just for your face!,"Reviewed in the United States on May 25, 2025","I have very dry skin and since entering my 40's realized I need to layer my moisturizers. I focused on Korean skin care and learned about centella. This stuff is amazing! I started by using it on my face, neck, and cuticles where I really wanted to focus on hydration. I use this under my other lotions and it's been a complete game changer. It absorbs quickly, has no scent, and truly adds the mouturizatjon my skin needs. I've been using this product for over 1 years and just this week tried it on my hair. I applied a full dropper to my damp hair - 1 dropper to half of my hair (avoiding the roots), I have fine thick hair. Then I added my usual curl cream on top of that. My hair is incredibly soft and shiny without being weighed down.
I also apply this stuff to skin wounds once they lost their scab. My biopsy scar from 1 year ago fully disappeared and it's help with many therapy scratches and scrapes. I wish I could get this stuff in larger bottles!
The bottles are also beautiful and I've cleaned them and given them to friends or kept myself for anything you may need a dropper bottle for.
I prefer this amber formula over the ""blue"" one as I find it is actually more hydrating."
,Love this product!!! It hydrates my skin like no other and isn’t greasy,"Reviewed in the United States on May 26, 2025","I purchased this as a last ditch effort to find something to HYDRATE my skin without leaving an oily, messy film on my face when it was rubbed it. I have tried most lotions and facial creams/gels and they either over hydrate my face so I look and am oily, or they just clog my pores and don’t hydrate me. I have hormonal acne and large pores. My face is normally oily and products like I mentioned either add to the oil or dry me out and add to the acne. This product is AMAZING!!!! It is light weight and has no smell. I apply to my face at night. It is light weight and not greasy. It rubs in and makes my face radiant and soft! It HYDRATES my skin without making it oily or clogging my pores. My skin is very sensitive and this is a game changer. I normally don’t wear makeup, but when I do, it doesn’t looked caked on or stick in my lines or wrinkles. It goes on smooth and looks great-no dry spots. I would highly recommend this to anyone who’s looking for something to calm their skin, and hydrate it without the greasy feeling and mess. Works wonders for my skin."
,Love it! Glad I received an authentic product. A must have for angry skin.,"Reviewed in the United States on April 27, 2025","Tired of facecare products for sensitive skin that contain a list with dozens of different ingredients. Being in desperate need of barrier repair and highly reactive to almost everything, I just wanted a single ingredient product (or as close as possible) to help calm the fire that is my face right now. After verifying authenticity, I gladly applied this soothing tonic to my face and the relief was pretty much instant. It does not cause me to break out (terrible to have overly dry and sensitive skin that still breaks out at 50+). This along with the CosRX snail mucin 96+ are the only items that my face tolerates at its worst, and right now that's where I'm at. Couldn't recommend this any more highly, it is a lifesaver for me. Please just make sure that you are receiving an authentic product as there are many counterfeits on the beauty market these days."
,Good for oily and dry skin,"Reviewed in the United States on June 5, 2025","I have been using this for 2 months now and feel like I visibly see results/helps with fine lines and wrinkles. I also have very oily but also dry skin, and this has been a great product that hydrates without making my skin feel oily. I only use it at bed time."
,Buen tamaño,"Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2025","No siento que disminuya las rojeces, que es la principal acción del suero. Tiene buen tamaño."
,My Staple,"Reviewed in the United States on May 21, 2025","I will be buying this product as long as it is sold. While it is not necessarily a life changing product in that it was a miracle in changing my skin, it did over time significantly improve my overall skin health and reduces any redness I may have. Highly recommend for sensitive skin people like me, great staple product that I have bought 3+ times now and will continue to do!"
,Skin changing,"Reviewed in the United States on May 17, 2025",Absolutely incredible. I had gotten a sample in a beauty box and thought hmm I’ll try it. After a couple of uses I needed the full size. This is 1000% a skin saver. Light and doesn’t feel greasy. Absorbs quickly. Feels good and my skin looks amazing. This will always be part of my lineup.
,Loved this,"Reviewed in the United States on May 13, 2025","Used this while I was pregnant on my stomach and it made my skin so soft! Felt super moisturizing. I know that stretch marks are genetic, but I do feel like using this with bio oil. And staying hydrated was the best thing ever. Loved the scent and it wasn’t sticky at all! I would buy this for anyone in my life"
