Incredible All-Around Flosser,"Reviewed in the United States on December 18, 2024","I bought this on black friday and haven't regretted it (much) since!
Pros:
1. Not very bulky, but I feel it does require two hands to hold
2. I never have to refill during use, since the tank is just the right size
3. I'd say the noise level is pretty modest, similar to an electric toothbrush
4. The battery life is incredible! I haven't had to charge it in 2 weeks!!
5. I got a beautiful turquoise color and it looks so pretty sitting on my bathroom countertop, so it's definitely not an eyesore
6. There is definitely a learning curve when trying to figure out how to use it well without making too much of a mess (I always make a mess, though!) This is my first water flosser and it only took about 2 days to figure out how to use it, but I soaked my mirror, walls, countertops, clothes, and floor during the process, so have towels on hand while you're still learning lol!!
7. It took me a few days to adjust to the water pressure since I have incredibly sensitive gums as well as some pretty bad gingivitis. I have bled maybe once since the 2 weeks I've had this flosser, but my gums would feel sore and achy after every use. That took a while to go away.
8. I love that it comes with a tongue scraper nozzle!! I feel like it really helps with bad breath!
9. I also like how it comes with so many different types of nozzles for everyone's different needs. I just use the standard and tongue scraper, but it also has a second standard nozzle tip, which is pretty cool. You have to replace tips every 2-3 months anyways, so with the two standard tips they supply, you won't have to buy replacements for 6 months!!

Cons:
NUMBER ONE: THE BIGGEST CON-The charger port is covered by a tiny rubber stopper that you have to take off in order to charge the device. DO NOT LOSE THIS RUBBER STOPPER!!! The very FIRST day I got this, I lost it for about 30 mins and there is no replacement for it. You can't have water get into the charging port or else it won't work, so you really cannot lose this stopper or else you'll have to replace the whole flosser!! They should've made it like the flapper on the tank that is still connected when you take it off to pour water into the reservoir. Trying to keep track of this tiny stopper is a wayyy more stressful than it should be! Lol
2. When you use the flosser, it gets all slippery with water running down the body of it, so make sure you have a good grip! That's why I use it with two hands, so that I'm extra careful to not drop it. Also, try not to accidentally press the buttons during use. Not fun lol!
3. The water reservoir for this flosser doesn't dry between uses, which makes me anxious that it could start to grow water mold. I always leave the flap open to try and help it airdry, but it is still always wet the next day. I haven't had any issues yet with bacteria overgrowth, but I wish there was a way to open it up and dry it.

Overall: I'd give this an 8.5/10! For a first time water flosser user, I feel very lucky that this was my first experience! I'm unsure of how well it cleans my teeth, though, so I'll have to check with my dentist during my next appointment to see if there's any improvements. And that little stopper for the charger port brings this rating down 1 whole point because of the mini heart attacks it's given me!! But the ease of use, battery life, color, power, noise, and water pressure are all way beyond my expectations and are truly a treat for your teeth and gums! And the tank not drying or being able to be dried between uses brings the rating down another 0.5 point. But otherwise, this is a really high quality product! It's got a good price and not too many downsides, so I would cautiously recommend to friends if they had a good memory and could keep track of things. But for fellow ADHD folks, this may not be the best, simply because I don't think you can have that stopper replaced or purchase a replica of it. You may have to buy the whole flosser again or just go with a different one that doesn't have such a tiny part you have to keep track of!"
"Powerful, Portable, and Perfect for Daily Use!","Reviewed in the United States on June 2, 2025","I’ve been using the COSLUS Water Dental Flosser for a few weeks now, and I can confidently say it has become a permanent part of my oral care routine. It’s compact and cordless, which makes it perfect for travel, but it’s powerful enough to rival countertop models.

The 300ML water tank is the ideal size—big enough to get a full clean without constant refills, yet still easy to hold and maneuver. The different pressure modes let you customize your flossing experience (especially great for sensitive gums), and the pulse function really helps clean between teeth and along the gumline.

It’s also truly waterproof (IPX7), so I use it right in the shower with no worries. Battery life is excellent—I've only charged it once so far and it's still going strong!

I feel like my mouth is noticeably fresher and cleaner after each use, and my dentist even commented on how much less plaque buildup I had during my last visit.

If you're looking for a convenient, effective, and affordable alternative to string floss, I highly recommend this COSLUS model. It’s a game changer for dental hygiene at home or on the go!"
Does the job!,"Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2025","Works as well as the ""name brand"" at a much more reasonable price
Pros: easy to operate, buttons are set up well to not change function mid-use, LOVE the drainage hole at the bottom (and use it to refill as well). Appreciated the multiple heads. Battery life seems good (have used a couple weeks, not daily, without recharging), tank is reasonably sized (one use friendly unless you're on a recovery mission of particularly stubborn debris)
Cons: the narrow bottle top is a pain (I think that's been fixed in newer models); there's not any kind of ""guide"" to the various settings, and the soft silicone top attachment is kind of finnicky; sometimes it takes a couple seconds to build up the pressure, which is normal, but is a thing you should know. I can't see the settings when it's in my mouth, once you start, you kind of have to keep going unless you turn it all the way off

Overall, would purchase (or recommend) the newer model with the wider mouth if I was in the market again"
Absolute game-changer for oral care—my mouth has never felt cleaner!,"Reviewed in the United States on May 18, 2025","I recently overhauled my entire oral care routine and added this COSLUS Water Dental Flosser, along with a natural tooth oil (Heal Thy Mouth Blend), and the results have been nothing short of incredible. This flosser has made such a noticeable difference in how clean my mouth feels that it’s become a staple in my morning and evening routines.

For context: I stopped using fluoride-based toothpaste about five years ago for personal health reasons—but what I didn’t fully realize was how much fluoride had been doing to help prevent decay. Over time, I started noticing signs of tooth decay—brown spots between my teeth, plaque buildup, and the frustrating feeling that no matter how much I brushed or flossed, my mouth never felt truly clean. That was a wake-up call.

I did a deep dive into natural, high-impact solutions and found this flosser. It’s been an essential upgrade. First tip: use it in the shower the first few times—it’s powerful, and practicing without worrying about making a mess makes a big difference.

I started with the periodontal attachment on the soft setting because of my tooth sensitivity, and it was gentle enough to get used to without any discomfort. Within a week, I’d moved to one of the standard tips and was even using the regular mode occasionally.

What’s wild is how effective it is at getting food particles and buildup out. You truly start to feel what clean teeth are supposed to feel like—and once you do, you can’t go back. I find myself looking forward to that “ultra clean” feeling after meals because the difference is that noticeable.

If you’re thinking about upgrading your oral hygiene—especially if you’ve made the switch away from fluoride-based products—this is one of the best investments you can make. It helps restore that deeper level of oral care and truly makes your mouth feel refreshed and supported in a whole new way."
Very useful tool!,"Reviewed in the United States on June 22, 2025","I want to start this off and say this thing is great. When you learn how to properly use it. I suggest starting with the soft or massage setting because I kicked it to the highest and had the nozzle angled wrong and sprayed up into my gums instead of between my teeth. Practice makes perfect and I love this thing but definitely be careful.

It's a great size, holds just enough water to floss through all of your teeth in one fill and I love that it has the cap on the bottle bottom for easy fill up. The extra attachments given with it are very nice too. Very worth the price and works well."
"Good water pressure, long lasting battery","Reviewed in the United States on June 5, 2025","If you're someone who is revolted by flossing, and you love the Waterpik but don't have room to keep it on your bathroom counter, then this is the machine for you. I chose this unit over other cordless version because someone said the water pressure is surprisingly powerful, and it is true. It also holds a charge a long time - how long? I don't know! I've used it for two weeks, twice a day and so far it hasn't lost pressure or needed charging. The fact that it's waterproof and I can use it in the shower is also great. The reservoir is big enough to do my full mouch if I'm diligent and don't start daydreaming. But if I run out of water before I'm done, it's no big deal to fill up again and keep going. In terms of countertop space, It's a little wider than a standard electric toothbrush. But it could also go in a shallow drawer. The convenience of it gets me to waterfloss everyday."
"Nice Pressure, Solid So Far","Reviewed in the United States on June 4, 2025","I like this flosser. It has really nice pressure, and it actually feels like it’s cleaning between my teeth—not just spraying water around. I haven’t used most of the other attachments, just the main flosser part.

My dentist recommended switching to a water flosser instead of those dental pick flossers I had been using. She said the picks don’t wrap around the tooth properly and can cause gum damage. Since using this, I’ve definitely noticed the spaces between my teeth feel cleaner.

Haven’t had to recharge it yet, and it holds a good amount of water. The different pressure settings are cool too—there’s a little vibration or pulse setting that helps break stuff up. Overall, it’s been good to me so far. If anything weird happens, I’ll come back and update"
No cord and does the job intended as my first flosser,"Reviewed in the United States on May 11, 2025","Mostly happy with this flosser. A couple of things that keep it from being perfect for me: 1) The power button is very easy to either miss turning off, or turning on at the wrong time (which nicely sprays water on me and the bathroom walls. Yeah, very funny!!). 2) The hard plastic tips may not be intended to contact gums or teeth, but it's hard to direct it without that feedback. The softer tip really doesn't help me. I would like a thicker tip that cushions during use. 3) It puts out a lot of water in use and I have to refill it for each use.

On the plus side this thing works very, very well at removing food particles. I use floss after using it and my teeth never have much left. I feel this is achieving my goal of better cleaning to avoid cavities. If I ever upgrade I will keep this one as a cool Conceal & Carry squirt gun!"
Great water flosser,"Reviewed in the United States on May 21, 2025","My dental hygienist prefers water flossing over using actual floss, and fortunately, I do too.
I’d been using another brand of water flosser, and it broke after a few years. I purchased this one, which is almost exactly the same as my previous one, but slightly better. It comes with a few attachments for different functions (gums, etc.), but I just use one of them. It holds a lot of water, so I don’t need to refill it mid-use. It’s rechargeable, and the charge lasts quite a while.
The charger is USB, and does not come with the plug that goes into the wall outlet. That’s the only drawback. I’m using the plug that came with my previous flosser. If I didn’t have that, I’d need to charge it from my computer or a battery.
All in all, though, I’m very happy with this water flosser. It’s powerful, makes my teeth and gums feel great, and I look forward to using it."
A Powerful and Portable Oral Irrigator with Minor Flaws,"Reviewed in the United States on March 12, 2025","The COSLUS Water Dental Flosser C20 is a highly functional and well-designed cordless oral irrigator that offers an excellent alternative to traditional flossing. With a 300ML water tank, IPX7 waterproof rating, and multiple pressure settings, this device is particularly well-suited for individuals seeking a portable and travel-friendly oral hygiene solution. However, while it excels in many areas, there are a few minor drawbacks to consider.

Pros:
✅ Strong and Adjustable Water Pressure: The device offers multiple pressure settings, making it suitable for different sensitivity levels. The highest setting provides a powerful clean, effectively removing debris between teeth and along the gumline.

✅ Compact and Travel-Friendly: Its cordless, rechargeable design is perfect for those who travel frequently. The 300ML tank is large enough for a thorough clean but doesn’t make the device too bulky.

✅ IPX7 Waterproof Rating: The full-body waterproof design ensures safe use in the shower and easy cleaning under running water.

✅ Long Battery Life: With a USB rechargeable battery, it lasts multiple days on a single charge, making it convenient for both home and travel use.

✅ User-Friendly Design: The ergonomic grip and simple button controls make it easy to operate, even for beginners.

Cons:
⚠️ Water Tank Refilling Can Be Tedious: While 300ML is a decent size, some users may find themselves refilling it mid-session if they use higher pressure settings or require a longer flossing time.

⚠️ Learning Curve for First-Time Users: If you’re new to water flossers, there’s a slight learning curve in getting the angle and water flow right to avoid splashing. It takes a few tries to master the technique.

⚠️ Pressure Settings Could Be More Varied: While the pressure options are effective, a slightly gentler setting for extremely sensitive gums would be a welcome addition.

Final Verdict:
The COSLUS Water Dental Flosser C20 is a fantastic choice for those looking for an efficient, portable, and powerful oral irrigator. It delivers strong cleaning performance, is travel-friendly, and has an impressive battery life. While the water tank capacity and learning curve could be improved slightly, these are minor inconveniences compared to the overall effectiveness of the product. If you’re seeking a cost-effective and reliable water flosser, this is a solid investment for your dental care routine."
Great water flosser! Recommend,"Reviewed in the United States on June 2, 2025","This is my first time using a water flosser and I must say this brand is impressive!! They have three modes: clean, soft, and massage. At first it was painful to use it as I was still getting a hang of it but it grew on me quickly. My teeth haven’t felt any cleaner. I highly recommend for anyone who wants to advance their oral hygiene. The quality is good and it seems very sturdy/durable. It also comes with several heads! Still understanding how each one works but I’m happy with this purchase:) The battery life is also fantastic; haven’t had to charge for a while! I forget that it even needs to charge! I also got the electric toothbrush of this same brand and the battery life is also great!!"
"Didn't come with the owner's manual like the first one did, only a quick start guide.","Reviewed in the United States on June 4, 2025","This is my second one. The first one lasted a year and a few months. I expected a longer life. However, compared to the Sonic Care flosser I had before it, the Coslus is hands down the best! And at half the price! I was disappointed the new one didn't come with the owner's manual like the first one did. The first one told you how to remove the battery before disposing of the flosser. I like they were concerned about environmental consideration. Perhaps their leaving the manual out was just an oversight. Overall, it's a good product."
"If you hate to floss, you need this!","Reviewed in the United States on March 30, 2025","This is my second time purchasing this unit. The first one lasted a little over a year. It still worked, but the pressure was diminished. I had never performed any cleaning (vinegar) to dissolve deposits in the system but now do so with this one! I liked the first one so much that I knew I wanted the same brand and model!

It holds a charge well, I can usually go up to a week in beetween charges while water flossing twice daily. There is no ""low power"" indicator, but when I feel the pressure start to decrease, I recharge it. I like the small tank size. It is more than adequate for a good ""floss"". I can refill it each time with slightly warm water which makes it more comfortable for my gums. There are several different attachment heads, but I always use the same one.

I really hate dental floss. I use it, but not daily because it is so inconvenient. This device has been a game changer! It is so easy and convenient! I use this device after every brushing (because it is so much easier than flossing). Now, if I don't have it handy after eating certain foods like cilantro, parsley, pork or chicken, I go crazy! It quickly removes food debris that brushing does not.

In the past, my dentist and periodontist have always scolded me for not flossing regularly enough. I have already made 6 trips to my periodontist for check-ups and cleanings since using this device. He no longer scolds me! Instead he just says, ""Excellent job with yuor dental routine""! If you hate to floss, YOU NEED THIS! It doesn't completely replace the need for regular flossing, but it certainly helps if you don't manage to floss daily!"
I should have bought this a long time ago!,"Reviewed in the United States on May 27, 2025","My dental hygienist kept telling me to buy a water pic, but I kept thinking about the ones back in the 70’s/80’s where you fill up a tank and it gets all over everything, and clutters up the bathroom sink. This, however, is magic! No mess, compact, and it is so easy to use! It definitely gets food out of the teeth and there are different settings to choose from if you wish. Yes, one must still floss and brush, but this just makes your teeth feel so clean, especially around the gums. I should have purchased this a long time ago. It is a joy to use and it works wonders, especially after eating popcorn or anything with chia seeds. Great purchase for sure!"
It's cool,"Reviewed in the United States on June 22, 2025",Hard on the gums it shoots hard if you use it first time do it in the shower cause your gonna make a mess. I really like this product it cleans my teeth good. Not a substitute for floss ide say floss every nite still and if u can use this too. But I like using this in the morning
It sure cleans!,"Reviewed in the United States on June 7, 2025","My oral hygienist recommended I get a water flosser during my last cleaning. Getting older and I've got a crown where the gum is receding, exposing the gap between the tooth roots.

I pulled up Amazon on the phone, found this one and she said that it's the one she uses. The device is easy to setup and run. Make sure the water is warm. I was amazed at how many food particles were in the sink after using (and this after I'd brushed and flossed). Getch ya one!!"
Great product,"Reviewed in the United States on June 2, 2025","I am giving this a four only because I dropped it and the stopper broke off, it’s a flaw but if you keep up with the broken piece it’s still a great product.
I have braces and while I don’t think anything can take the place of dental floss flossing, this is a great alternative for the evenings I am too tired to take time to floss.
It is great for traveling, is high powered, and holds the perfect amount of water. The tube is easy to remove to clean.
Well with the money. I would buy again."
Flossee,"Reviewed in the United States on June 22, 2025",I have tightly spaced teeth and flossing is difficult in the back. I bought this as a supplement to flossing. It’s very powerful and holds a charge well. Wish the fill slot was not in the bottom of the product. I have bumped it open more than one time and spilled it.
"2 year warranty, good level of power","Reviewed in the United States on May 13, 2025","I have never owned a Water Pic, but I wanted to try and do my own dental routine that is very thorough and eliminate the hygienist so here goes. I have used it once today and it was easy to use and not too hard to learn but it will be a learning process to new skill to learn to angle it properly and not get water everywhere It looks to be a good quality tool and had a 2 year warranty which I appreciate. It doesn't come with a plug in adapter due to the fact that most people have an abundance of these so I'll look for one. If all else fails the company will send one by request it says. Good instructions and comes with several different tips..so far I am very happy with my purchase and it saves me going to the dentist so often for cleanings."
GREAT customer service!,"Reviewed in the United States on June 3, 2025","The 5 star rating is based on warranty service which is great!

My unit stopped charging after 3 months. I thought for sure it was my loss to bear. But the packaging claims incredible service and it is. A Rep got back to my email within an hour, asked a few questions, I sent a few pictures. And two hours later, I had noticed that a replacement will be delivered to me in Hawaii in 35 days.

No one looked a unit to fail, but superb customer service goes looooong way retaining customers, and Generating referrals."
keeps the spaces between my teeth clean,"Reviewed in the United States on June 16, 2025","I'd been smoking for about 5 years. I decided to make a change in my life and stop smoking. I had to go to the dentist a lot because my bad habits caused my teeth to suffer quite a bit. Now, I've been a year without knowing what it means to go to the dentist for something serious like cavities. This device really works. I love it."
Must have,"Reviewed in the United States on June 17, 2025",I love this water flosser!!! It has 3 different modes and it has a big tank so the water last longer and you do not have to refill it multiple times to floss your teeth. I would have given it 5 stars but the piece you insert at the top twist around when flossing.
Works well in the shower,"Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2025","It does have quite a lot of force. They do include a starter brush which will be softer on sensitive gums, or when you first use the product. I recently switched to the regular nozzle and it's working just great, I can tell when it gets out food from between my teeth. I only use it in the shower because it sprays quite a lot. I wish the filler hole were a little bit bigger, but you can do it from a shower nozzle. Can't comment on the battery life, because I haven't had to recharge it yet. I guess that's a good thing"
First time water pik user,"Reviewed in the United States on May 5, 2025","I did my purchase based on reviews on Amazon and reading different articles on water piks. My use is based on a week use....

Charging was quick and soooo far no recharging. I've used every single night.
Water storage is enough once you get used to stopping it before you take it out of your mouth (lol) let's just say THE first 3 nights my mirror and wall got a cleaning. No leaking from the unit...
Quality overall is great. It has three settings clean, soft and massage. The first time I did use the clean setting I had it too close to the gum line so you can make your gums bleed if not careful...it also warns you in the instructions (make sure you read these) There are several attachments which are easy to switch out, even a tongue cleaner... also if you have braces there's a special attachment just for you.

There's 2 year warranty when you register your pik."
No identification of the various tips,"Reviewed in the United States on June 7, 2025","Nice device but it has no explanation about how each of the different tips are used for. Included are two Standard tips, then one each of the following: orthodontic tip, periodontal tip, and one tongue scraper. I have the tips but don't know which is which.
Could be easily resolved. Just put the information on your website. I looked. It's not there."
Tiny removable tab that will be lost very easily while charging & to big for children to use,"Reviewed in the United States on May 10, 2025",Just received my order everything looks fine but would like to make 1 comment that I see as a design problem. The spot where you charge the hand held machine is a tiny tab that you pull off so the you can plug in. The tab is not attached at all and is the size of a small button which will be lost in no time at all leaving an uncovered plug where you plug in to charge. Note I did return both water picks that I bought not because of anything wrong with them but only because I had bought them for two children and they were too big for them to use properly which never crossed my mind when I bought them. I guess I will try to find small ones made for small hands.
Great flosser,"Reviewed in the United States on June 4, 2025","I read the reviews how powerful and strong it was, and the majority of the people were extremely satisfied. The first time I used it I guess I was expecting the pressure to knock the enamel off my teeth, but the pressure wasn’t that strong so I didn’t think it would be that effective. Well, I proved myself wrong. My teeth have never felt cleaner. I had a little bit of peppermint oil to the water
I highly recommend this product"
So good! Even cleans what you don’t feel is there,"Reviewed in the United States on June 11, 2025","I didn’t expect to love it this much, but I do! It always finds something left in my teeth even when I think they’re clean. I feel the standard mode is kinda strong (maybe I’m just not used to it), so I mostly use the soft mode and it's perfect. Love that it’s portable and has no cords - really easy to handle. Great buy!"
Easy to use and good productl,"Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2025","I am very happy I purchased the water pick or aqua flossing. It was very easy to use and convenient. I'd recommend this for anyone looking to have cleaner between the teeth and gums area. I'm having some bridge work done and needed something. I glad I chose this product. The convenience of charging is exceptional and also the ability to floss in all and areas of my mouth. Good quality product. Easy to hold. Not too big. Device only has minimal noise and no leaking. Also, includes several attachments that I will try."
It’s great!,"Reviewed in the United States on April 19, 2025","This is my first time ever using a water flosser, and I have to say I’m genuinely impressed. I wasn’t sure what to expect at first, but after using it daily for the past few weeks, I can confidently say it’s a total game changer for my oral hygiene routine.

It leaves my mouth feeling incredibly clean — much more than traditional floss ever did. It’s super easy to use, gentle on the gums, and reaches spots I could never get to before. I’ve actually started to look forward to using it each day, which says a lot!

One of the things I appreciate most is the battery life. It lasts a long time on a single charge, which makes it perfect for daily use and even travel. If you’re on the fence about getting one, don’t hesitate. I wish I had gotten one sooner!"
Great Product & Customer Service,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2025","I don't write a lot of reviews but you have to give credit where credit is due. I really like my Dental Flosser, especially on the highest setting. It's about as compact as you can get seeing how a substantial amount of water has to be added to get the job done. All the working components are as compact as you can get. And their customer service is second to none with my experience with them. Courteous, helpful and fast responses making sure your problem has been resolved."
"Fun, Effective, and Easy to Use – A Game Changer for My Oral Hygiene Routine!","Reviewed in the United States on April 24, 2025","I’m absolutely in love with this pink water flosser! Not only is it a cute addition to my bathroom, but it’s also incredibly effective at cleaning between my teeth. I was a bit skeptical at first, since I’ve always used traditional floss, but after just a few uses, I’m convinced that this is a game changer for my oral hygiene.

The water pressure is adjustable, so I can easily find the setting that’s most comfortable for me. It feels gentle yet powerful enough to remove food particles and plaque that regular floss might miss. I love how easy it is to use — the ergonomic design fits perfectly in my hand, and the tank is simple to fill. Plus, the pink color adds a little fun to my daily routine!

What really sold me on this flosser is how much cleaner my teeth feel afterward. I used to struggle with reaching certain spots with traditional floss, but the water flosser covers all areas, even the back molars, and leaves my mouth feeling fresh and thoroughly clean. It's especially great for people with braces, implants, or sensitive gums.

The battery life is solid, and I’ve been able to use it several times between charges. It’s also super easy to clean and maintain, which I really appreciate."
Works well,"Reviewed in the United States on June 21, 2025",Works as expected. My only complaint is it doesn’t come with any kind of bag or way to keep the various heads together. The water pressure is great.
"It's a nice quality unit, but I'm returning it","Reviewed in the United States on March 23, 2024","This was my first ever water flosser. I'm 73, and have always brushed arduously, multiple times per day. In the last twenty years, I had good dental checkups with rare cavities. The Covid pandemic changed that. Clinics in my area (rural Maine) shut down, and my finances got worse. Result: no check ups for three years (and therefore no dental hygienists) led to seven cavities. Dentist said, paraphrasing, ""You're not being effective enough on plaque with just a brush. Get a water pik.""

So that evening, after reading some basic online reviews and MANY customer reviews on Amazon, I bought this one. Remember, I'm a total newbie to these kinds of tools, and the learning curve is steep, kind of like learning to ride a bike or roller skate. (Expect goofs.)

When I received it and unpacked it, I could feel quality (that matches all the Amazon reviews I read). I used it for about ten days. Half way through, my dentist said, ""Yes, this is a MAJOR improvement. Keep it up and you won't have problems."" Good.

But in the last few days, I started understanding why this one -- as quality as it is -- is the wrong tool for me.

But being a beginner, I'm still learning how to ride it ... er, use it effectively. I've tried it over the sink -- messy -- and in the shower (before I shower); the latter is less messy, but not convenient for a quick water floss after lunch. I'm finding the learning curve is steeper than expected with this unit ... which IMHO is not a good one for beginners to start with. (It's more of a portable unit for traveling by experienced water flosser users.)

Here's why it's not right for me. First, it's larger and heavier than is comfortable (at least for me, an older novice) to manipulate effectively. It contains 300 ml of water, making it heavier (300 ml is approx 0.6 lbs).

Second, and worse, there are only three water speeds, and two are not very different. So it's basically fast and faster. For starters, I found the fastest speed to be way too much water; it actually hurt my beginner gums. But even on ""soft"", it's too fast for me. It doesn't hurt, but it's just too much water too fast. I want to be able to adjust to 3 (of ten) to learn with, then dial up the speed as I get better with it.

Third, and probably worst of all, I can't figure out how to hold it securely without pressing the push button controls accidentally. Those controls are on the ""back"" side of the narrow part, just below the attachment port for the nozzle. When I grip it tight enough to prevent it slipping from my grasp when wet, when I'm trying to aim it properly in my mouth without choking myself or shooting water all over the bathroom, I get a little panicked and press the off switch or accidentally change the speed. (A video of me during one of those times would look like a slapstick comedy routine worthy of The Three Stooges.)

So I'm returning this (already printed my return label) and replacing it with a Waterpik electric unit with a hose and speed controls on the main unit, not on the handheld piece. It's costing me roughly $23 more than this ($62 shipped), but for my beginner needs, it'll work better.

But again, I want to stress that my issues with this unit have zero to do with quality of functioning or the unit itself. I think for an experienced user who can water floss with a portable unit while making out a grocery list in your mind, this is a fine option. I commend Coslus for producing a quality portable unit for such a low price point. I would have purchased their ""desktop"" model, but it's outside of my budget."
Great value for the money,"Reviewed in the United States on June 21, 2025","Great value for the money. It has three settings
and the “clean” setting is surprisingly strong and efficient. It seems well made and I don’t need to recharge for over a week. The water reservoir is perfect."
Company is a pain in the rear for teviews,"Reviewed in the United States on June 22, 2025",The product works well and the request for areview is intrusive. I would buy more products if I never have to do another review
Water floss,"Reviewed in the United States on June 4, 2025","Absolutely loved the water floss, the water storage is also sufficient enough so I didn't need to constantly refill. Only issue with it for me is that it's kinda big and also still created a little bit of a mess with water everywhere, even after properly adjusting and using it. Other than that, i am pretty satisfied with the product."
Excellent product.,"Reviewed in the United States on June 19, 2025",This is an excellent product. It's very easy to use and does an excellent job. You don't have to spend a lot of money. I am very pleased with this product. I would highly this product to anyone.
Water pick,"Reviewed in the United States on May 18, 2025","I’ve used this for about 2 months now. Overall I like it. It works great for me. There are two things I would like to point out. First, the lid on the water tank broke off pretty quickly but I can still use it. Just annoying to make sure I don’t loose it. Then I really wish there was a warning before it needs to charge. In the middle of me using it, it just turned off. Would have been nice to know before it ran out of charge."
Wish I'd gotten one sooner.,"Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2025","After many cleanings my dental hygienist said, despite my using floss, I should get a water flosser to better clean between my teeth. I bought this Coslus flosser and have been using it for several weeks. My first attempts were messy, and then I learned to lower my head and keep my lips together. It's quicker than flossing and doesn't leave the strands between the teeth when the floss frays or breaks. I wish I had gotten one years ago."
It works,"Reviewed in the United States on May 9, 2025","My dentists recommend me to try this due to my unhealthy gums. I really thought this is just another stupid thing most likely won’t work but it turn out to be the savior of my gum. It’s a little bit messy and definitely has a learning curve(the highest setting is powerful enough to strip paint) but once you get the hang of it you will see the difference it will make, of course assuming you actually use it everyday. Overall it is a great product with good build and good battery life. However, it’s is not for lazy people. If you can’t even spend 2 minutes to brush your teeth and too lazy to learn how to use this correctly i suggest you just save the money."
First time buyers,"Reviewed in the United States on June 9, 2025",This is a great product for someone starting out for first time. I like that it has a soft option for first time users. Only downfall is I wish it had a bag or some sort of storage for all the different parts.
Good deal,"Reviewed in the United States on June 3, 2025","So far, so good. It seems to be of good quality but I've only had for less than a month, so time will tell.The power button is really sensitive so you'll probably shoot some water into the ceiling or in your eye until you get used to the device. Good pressure and different modes to accommodate sensitive gums.
All told, it's a good buy in my opinion."
Gets the job done!,"Reviewed in the United States on June 1, 2025","I've had this water flosser for a few months now, and I'm very impressed with the battery life! Five minutes on the charger and it lasts for months!

It's quiet, doesn't leak, and flosses my teeth very well. I wish it held a little more water per tank, but overall, this is a great product!"
Nice for the price.,"Reviewed in the United States on June 2, 2025",Powerful and easy to use. Haven’t had any issues so far after a few months of using this. It’s quiet and seems durable. The flossing ability has been good and I am able to get in the hard to reach places. I’ve only charged it once as well so the battery is long lasting.
Good,"Reviewed in the United States on June 22, 2025",The push button start is a hazard. Other than that it works very well.
Good water flosser at a great price,"Reviewed in the United States on June 8, 2025",I've just tried this water flosser. It has good pressure and runs smoothly. It is easy to use and the directions that came with it are easy to understand. I would recommend this to anyone who searching for one.
Excellent Daily Flosser — Powerful and Easy to Use!,"Reviewed in the United States on May 27, 2025","I’ve been using the COSLUS water flosser every day and it’s been fantastic. It holds a good amount of water, so I’m not constantly refilling it. The spray is strong—perfect for deep cleaning around the gums. It’s also super easy to charge and refill, which makes it convenient for daily use. I love that it comes with a variety of pick options, so I can switch based on what I need. My gums feel noticeably cleaner since I started using it. Highly recommended!"
Satisfaction!,"Reviewed in the United States on June 15, 2025","Works as it should! Not real loud, comes with different attachments, and holds plenty of water for usage. I have been pleased with it!"
"Recommend this flosser, but you will need to fill it up multiple times.","Reviewed in the United States on April 19, 2025","I got this for my son to use with his braces. He has been doing well with it. Though now that I have a tank flosser, we realize he needs to fill it up like 3-4 times to get his mouth thoroughly. He no longer has braces, and has taken to use it in the shower. He fills it up twice. The battery life is pretty good. It does have the ability to turn up and down the sensitivity of the water pressure. This was a feature that we really liked about this flosser. So at this time, it is a 4/5 stars. He has been using it for a few months now and it has been doing very well. I would recommend it."
