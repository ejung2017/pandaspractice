Great Product,"Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2025",I have had this water flosser for 2 months now. It's a game changer! I have only had to charge it the initial time. The 3 different settings are nice depending on how sensitive your gums are. I never realized how much cleaner in-between my teeth could be until I started using this. I like that you can take it with you if you travel and it seems to be very well made. I highly recommend this product.
"Pretty good, with room to improve.","Reviewed in the United States on June 1, 2025","Vendor was a 5 out of 5. Product is 3.5 out of five. It's convenient and all but it does not generate the pressure you would get from a corded unit with a larger water reservior, which would alos be an improvement.,"
A fine product at a good price,"Reviewed in the United States on May 13, 2025","This product is exceptional, and I highly recommend it. I especially like the periodontal tip. Other fine aspects of the product - you can see how much water is left in the tank, and it's easy to fill. You can manage the speed of the flow of water - I like to use the soft speed. After you use this product correctly, your mouth will feel amazing! This is a great product, at a reasonable price. Read the directions carefully - you will see a picture of how to use each dental tip."
3 modos para diferentes usos!,"Reviewed in the United States on June 8, 2025","Producto excelente. 3 modos de operaci√≥n para distintas necesidades (y se siente realmente diferente cada uno)
Y se carga con USB! A nosotros que vivimos en un pa√≠s con electricidad de 220V, no necesitar transformador es muy √∫til"
Great for Travel and Every Day Use,"Reviewed in the United States on June 7, 2025","This portable water pick works great and is so convenient when traveling. In my opinion, it‚Äôs better to use a water pick when you have veneers. Regular floss pulls at the veneers constantly and creates a risk for damage."
Great Tool for Home Dental Care,"Reviewed in the United States on June 1, 2025","I'm working at being more proactive taking care of my teeth/gums. Had never used a water flosser before so there was a big learning curve to try and not get water everywhere, LOL! It is now an important part of my daily dental care. Only brushing does not do a thorough job."
great support,"Reviewed in the United States on June 1, 2025",The pump stopped working after 12 months. I emailed their support and they responded the next day with some tips to fix the problem. When this didn't work they sent me a replacement at no charge which I received in 3 days.
EXCELLENT PRODUCT. WOULD BUY AGAIN!,"Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2025","EXCELLENT PRODUCT. WOULD BUY AGAIN.

I've had my Coslus water pick flosser for a year, and I absolutely love it. It's simple to use, easy to refill, has multiple power and speed settings, and I can go for several months between recharges because the battery lasts forever! I just plugged it in to charge a few minutes ago, and I think this is only the 2nd or 3rd time I've ever re-recharged it in twelve months of ownership."
Glad I picked this one.,"Reviewed in the United States on May 15, 2025","Excellent product! I replaced an old Water Pick and was amazed at the power this irrigator has. Seriously, start on the softer setting before using the higher pressure setting. The company sent a thank you email and has been great at responding to questions. More companies need this kind of customer service.
I joked with my dentist and said that this irrigator could put out a warehouse fire in the next block from the amount of water and strength it has. It was a joke, but it really is strong."
Powerful,"Reviewed in the United States on June 8, 2025",‚ÄúSoft‚Äù mode is a lot more powerful than I expected. It‚Äôs pretty loud but it works well. It hasn‚Äôt leaked for me at all
Works Great!,"Reviewed in the United States on May 19, 2025","I bought this to help irrigate an extraction site and this does the job. I was skeptical that it would do much more than that but I can truly see this as a flossing alternative! So far, it‚Äôs done a great job with the irrigation and a good job with flossing. I haven‚Äôt experienced any leaking from the fill site either. It comes with multiple heads for different tasks, charged quickly and is easy to handle. What a great gadget for $30ish bucks!"
Durable,"Reviewed in the United States on June 2, 2025","This is an amazing off brand water flosser. It certainly does the job and holds the water in well
It seems very durable and the pressure is incredible. My teeth feel amazing after using. I love that there is a bottom hole to release or fill up with water."
I really do like it,"Reviewed in the United States on May 27, 2025","I like it a lot. ONLY complaint is the placement of the button you push to work it üò≥. I‚Äôve gotten better, but I inevitably push it when I‚Äôm done and putting it back on the counter. I have to assume I‚Äôm not the only one this happens to (üò¨ü§ûüèª)."
Works like a charm,"Reviewed in the United States on May 24, 2025","I got this oral irrigator because the reviews were good and the price was right. So far, it's gotten the job done. I usually just use the soft squirt and it gets the job done along with brushing and oral rinse. Water capacity is ample and lasts a few days. I haven't had to charge it yet after a couple weeks of use. I'm satisfied with this device and would recommend."
Good product,"Reviewed in the United States on June 1, 2025",Came in the time frame that was expected. Easy to use but I wish there was a video tutorial to make it quicker to learn how to properly use it. Overall nice addition to my dental hygiene toolkit
Excellent for Perio-Cleanse,"Reviewed in the United States on June 1, 2025","Purchased last year (2024) when a 2nd waterpik went on the fritz. Outstanding product: it is much better than well-known brand. Durable, holds a charge, easier to clean. Has 3 useful settings: really does an outstanding cleaning. Recent perio-exam was ""2 thumbs up""."
Useful flosser,"Reviewed in the United States on May 27, 2025","My wife usea this and shared the product is great. Seller delivered promptly and information on the product was accurate. She easily integrated it into her routines. It's easy to use. The tank might appear to be too large but it's really easy to adjust to. With limited outlets on her side, she loves that its cordless compared to WaterPik she used before."
Good for braces,"Reviewed in the United States on June 3, 2025","Bought this for both my girls who have braces. It‚Äôs been a game changer. Has a plethora of heads to accommodate what you‚Äôre trying to use in your mouth. Ex: a head for braces, tongue scraper, gums etc. easy to use. Highly recommend."
LOVE LOVE LOVE,"Reviewed in the United States on May 27, 2025","LOVE LOVE LOVE this product! I had the old school one you had to leave on the counter and when it died i was in the market for a new one and this one DIDN'T DISSPOINT! i love this product and would purchase again! if you're not waterflossing, this is your sign! Love this product and i can't live w/ out it."
Good Water Flosser But Only Use Soft/Sensitive Setting,"Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2025",It‚Äôs a great water flosser all around. A little on the big side. And the normal setting is way too hard on my gums and causes massive bleeding. I‚Äôm only able to use the sensitive/soft setting. But other than that it does a tremendous job at getting all the junk out in between my teeth.
may not last very long,"Reviewed in the United States on April 18, 2025","This thing does a good job, just not for very long. Mine crapped out after six months. It makes noise as though the pump is working, but nothing comes out of the tip. It is advertised as having a three year life span, which seems reasonable for what it is - a small, battery operated, water flosser. Batteries seldom last more than three years, anyway. The problem is after six months it is not reasonable to throw it away and buy another. Another thing in its favor (which they advertise) is that it does go a long time between charges. I liked it; I just wish it lasted longer before crapping out."
Super easy!,"Reviewed in the United States on June 5, 2025","Very happy! I can take anywhere/use anywhere! Easy to charge (don‚Äôt need very often). I use in the shower and love it! My teeth/gums feel SO clean after!
Best is to floss, then use the water flosser, then brush!"
Great product!,"Reviewed in the United States on June 4, 2025",Dentist recommended and I chose this one because of price and ratings. For my husband and he was astonished to see all that it cleaned out for him. Dentist impressed with gum improvement after 3 months of using. Recommend
Works well for the price,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2025","I like it, good power and charging. Different heads are nice and holds a lot of water. Design is a little bulky though not a fan of where the buttons are but you get used to it."
Great flosser,"Reviewed in the United States on June 6, 2025",I used to have a waterpik but thing thing is a lot more convenient for travel and it's stronger too. Battery lasts a long while and with a rechargeable battery it's easy to keep charged.
Good for teeth,"Reviewed in the United States on June 7, 2025","The water expels faster than expected so be careful but it's great for a starter water flosser or long term. Noise isn't loud but isn't quiet either, the flossing ability is good as well."
Great service from manufacturer directly,"Reviewed in the United States on May 27, 2025",The first unit that we received was defective. I could not believe the amount of concern and cooperation offered by the company directly. They could not do enough. They immediately sent out a replacement and it has been working just fine since purchase. I am very satisfied with my purchase and the support the company did offer.
Tips rotate,"Reviewed in the United States on June 4, 2025",Good water pressure. However tips rotate when monuvering around your mouth. If they locked in 1 position I would give it 5 stars.
Amazing results! My mouth has never felt cleaner,"Reviewed in the United States on May 14, 2025","I recently started using and I‚Äôm seriously impressed! It‚Äôs gentle but powerful perfect for someone like me with sensitive gums. After just a few uses, I noticed a big difference in how clean my teeth feel, especially between the molars where floss usually misses.

The tank is easy to fill, and the pressure settings are great for adjusting based on what you need. It‚Äôs now part of my daily routine and I honestly feel like my oral hygiene has improved a lot. Highly recommended!"
Excellent travel appliance,"Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2025","Device seems to work well. Perfect travel companion for the purpose and convenience for which it was intended. Longevity remains to be determined over time. Functioned well on a recent trip, was happy with the performance."
Easy to use,"Reviewed in the United States on June 6, 2025",Easy to use . Bit uncomfortable on my gums. Saw a result right away the first time I used it. Love that it‚Äôs not hooked up to a cord and easy to clean
Great flosser!,"Reviewed in the United States on June 6, 2025",Great flosser! Easy to use. Nice sized tank and assortment of nozzles . Just be careful of the little cover to charger area as it's not tethered to the flosser
it is a good product!,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2025","I like to use the high speed. I like how easy is filling up with water and empty as well. After charging it last. forever, I didn‚Äôt have to charge often and I am using it every night. And the price was very reasonable üòä"
Awesome Flosser!,"Reviewed in the United States on May 9, 2025",I have always used an electrical water flosser but got tired of it taking up space on my bathroom counter. I did a lot of research and this rechargeable flosser was so highly rated I just had to give it a try. The water capacity is perfect to clean upper and lower teeth! The ‚Äúclean‚Äù setting is very powerful. I really like the different modes. Having 2 regular tips is a bonus. I love that I can take this with me when I travel as well as use it in the shower. That‚Äôs a real plus!
How well does it work,"Reviewed in the United States on May 27, 2025",Works really well and its super cute!‚Ä¶compared to the ‚Äúwaterpik‚Äù its smaller but does the same job! if you have bad teeth that are sensitive to brushing and getting into the gums thing guy will do the job!
The cost in the reliability both are good,"Reviewed in the United States on June 10, 2025",This is the second one I've purchased it works great much cheaper than the other brands that can cost $90. I will keep with this brand.
My water pik,"Reviewed in the United States on May 28, 2025",I like the various settings. The water reservoir holds more water than the other brands that I have used. I do not like the charging ability. I would rather the conventional plug in cord.My col
Tickled Pink,"Reviewed in the United States on April 2, 2025","Recently I dropped my old water flosser, and the plastic broke. After reading some positive reviews about this electric water flosser by COSLUS, I ordered it. (Donna K.'s review was helpful because she said ""make sure you don't lose the little cap that covers the USB port because it's not attached""; I'm being careful not to lose it, and I'll also see if replacement caps are sold.) Since I'm on a bit of a ""pink kick"" right now, I ordered the pink color. It arrived in a flash, thanks to Amazon Prime Same Day Delivery! :)

I like the way this pink water flosser looks in the bathroom. More importantly, it's easy to use, although I wish the instructions included in the package used larger print. I'm using the soft mode (middle button on the flosser) which is comfortable yet effective for removing the tiny bits of food that get stuck between my teeth. The package includes a cute tongue scraper which looks like a small pink spoon. I'm glad I chose this water flosser, and am hopeful that it will help keep my teeth and gums healthy."
Easy to use.,"Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2025","The item is well made and user-friendly. However, the small water reservoir requires frequent refills to complete flossing, and the charging port plug can be easily lost, compromising the unit's waterproof feature."
Better than others I‚Äôve used,"Reviewed in the United States on May 17, 2025","This works great. I wish there was a case that you could put it in to travel. There is a periodontal attachment but the tip is too soft, it bends at the tooth instead of getting in between. Other than that it is great. Doesn‚Äôt not leak which is a huge plus."
Better than floss,"Reviewed in the United States on May 15, 2025","Works great. Definitely have to practice with it, if you have never used one before. Have a hand towel handy. I like it much better than floss that shreds and gets stuck between your teeth. Gums and teeth get clean, you can feel the difference. Not sure on durability since I just received it. But highly recommend on performance if you have never used one."
Great Product,"Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2025",I have had this water flosser for 2 months now. It's a game changer! I have only had to charge it the initial time. The 3 different settings are nice depending on how sensitive your gums are. I never realized how much cleaner in-between my teeth could be until I started using this. I like that you can take it with you if you travel and it seems to be very well made. I highly recommend this product.
Great customer service!!!!,"Reviewed in the United States on May 17, 2025",I've had this item for 6 months when the water resevoir dropped and broke at the seam. I contacted the manufacturer and not only did they respond promptly but I had a replacement within the week. I initially ordered one based on dentist recommendation and I'm surprised at how well it works!!!!! Highly recommend!
10/10 > WaterPik,"Reviewed in the United States on May 21, 2025","Very impressed with the amount of pressure that comes out of the flosser. I bought this to replace my WaterPik that broke down and I‚Äôd chose this one over the WaterPik any day! Plus, it comes in cute colors. ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
Great alternative to a more recognizable brand for much less.,"Reviewed in the United States on May 21, 2025","This works great, just as well as the more recognized brand that this competes with. The reservoir seems larger than my previous water flosser from that other brand. This shipped with a handful of different tips, but I expect I'll stick with the standard tip. It's nice to have options, though."
Easy to use,"Reviewed in the United States on June 6, 2025",Easy to use . Bit uncomfortable on my gums. Saw a result right away the first time I used it. Love that it‚Äôs not hooked up to a cord and easy to clean
So worth the money!,"Reviewed in the United States on April 12, 2025","I'm very lazy about flossing, so I bought this just so I can use it in the shower. I usually shower after breakfast and this gets out so much food that gets stuck between teeth! I have very closely packed, crooked teeth and this works! There's a bit of a learning curve for sure, but once you get used to it, it's amazing. It also comes with a ton of attachments and is so much cheaper than a Waterpik. The battery life is great and the water container is big enough to where I can floss once completely without having to refill. This product makes me excited to floss LOL

Little life hack: do half water, half mouthwash and floss AFTER brushing your teeth at night. You will not wake up with morning breath."
‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê 5 Star Oral Hygiene Tool!,"Reviewed in the United States on May 6, 2025","Solid 10! 5 ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê stars all the way. The battery life is stellar and the pressure is perfect. It's enough to clean but not damage the gums! I love how it's easy to use, and refill. I've owned mine for 1 year and I have no complaints. Im sorry I didn't get to leaving a review till now! If your looking for a good water pick, then try this one out. It comes with a ton of accessories to help manage your oral hygiene and keep your pearly whites free of food and gunk buildup! The tongue cleaners helps a ton too! Check this product out to maintain your oral hygiene and keep the Kodak smile minty fresh!"
Good for braces,"Reviewed in the United States on June 3, 2025","Bought this for both my girls who have braces. It‚Äôs been a game changer. Has a plethora of heads to accommodate what you‚Äôre trying to use in your mouth. Ex: a head for braces, tongue scraper, gums etc. easy to use. Highly recommend."
Great Value,"Reviewed in the United States on June 12, 2025",This works great! It is a really good price and has a different settings for comfort. I've never used one of these before and found it very easy to use.
